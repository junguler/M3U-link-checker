# M3U-link-checker
wrestle with artifical dumbness (chat gpt 40) for a few hours to create a m3u link checker, this page has 3 main functions

* check local file: upload a m3u playlist and click this button to check it
* check online link: input the link of a m3u playlist (the raw file from github for example) and click the button to check it
* check pasted streams: copy and paste the streams title and links from wherever and click the button to check it

github pages are static, meaning this code runs on your device, you can just make a local copy of this page if you don't want to always open this page

this repo is made primarily as an auxiliary resource for my [m3u-radio-music-playlists](https://github.com/junguler/m3u-radio-music-playlists) repo and it's going to be linked there as well
